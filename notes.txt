🐍 Python Basics Notes
🔹 1. Python Introduction & Installation
✅ What is Python?
Python is an interpreted, high-level, dynamically typed programming language.

It is widely used for web development, data science, automation, AI, and more.

✅ Installing Python:
Download from python.org
Install and ensure python is added to PATH.

Check version:
python --version
🔹 2. Python IDLE & Shell
✅ What is Python IDLE?
IDLE (Integrated Development and Learning Environment) is Python’s built-in lightweight development environment.
You can write, edit, and run Python scripts in it.

>>> print("Hello, Python!")
Hello, Python!
To exit:
exit()  # or press Ctrl + Z (Windows) or Ctrl + D (Mac/Linux)

🔹 3. Python File Execution (.py Scripts)
Write Python code in a .py file.
Run the script from the terminal:

python my_script.py
🔹 4. Understanding __pycache__
✅ What is __pycache__?
Python automatically compiles scripts into bytecode (.pyc files) to speed up execution.
Compiled files are stored in a __pycache__ directory.

✅ How it works?
Run a Python script (example.py).

Python compiles it into bytecode (.pyc).

The bytecode is saved inside __pycache__/.
